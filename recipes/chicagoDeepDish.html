    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Home cooks will find deep-dish pizza, with its unique buttery cornmeal
      crust, more forgiving than its New York counterpart. No need to worry
      about having the hottest oven or too many toppings - just make sure your
      sauce is very thick and flavorful! I garnished mine with parsley and more
      Parmesan cheese.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1⅓ cups warm water</li>
      <li>2¼ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
      <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
      <li>¼ cup melted butter</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
      <li>1½ teaspoons fine salt</li>
      <li>½ cup cornmeal</li>
      <li>3¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons olive oil, or as needed, divided</li>
      <li>4 cups pizza sauce, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pour water into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle
        attachment. Sprinkle in yeast and let dissolve, about 10 minutes. Add
        olive oil, melted butter, sugar, salt, cornmeal, and most of the flour.
        Knead, stopping to scrape down the sides occasionally and adding more
        flour as needed, until smooth and elastic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface. Knead in extra flour
        if needed. Roll into a ball and place in a bowl greased with 1/2
        teaspoon olive oil. Cover with a plate and let rise in a warm spot until
        doubled in volume, 1 to 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, let pizza sauce simmer in a pot over low heat until very
        thick, 60 to 90 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Poke dough to deflate and turn out onto your work surface. Press and
        stretch out dough into a round shape 3 to 4 inches larger than a 12-inch
        cast iron skillet. Brush skillet with 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil. Place
        dough in the skillet; stretch and pull to evenly distribute it over the
        bottom and sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lay provolone cheese over the bottom of the crust. Scatter fresh
        mozzarella on top. Add Italian sausage and firm mozzarella. Ladle pizza
        sauce generously on top. Grate Parmesan cheese on top. Fold the edges of
        the crust in towards the center to seal in the sides. Drizzle crust and
        center with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the center of the preheated oven until crust sounds hollow and
        pizza is beautifully browned, about 35 minutes. Let rest for 10 minutes
        before slicing.
      </li>
    </ol>
